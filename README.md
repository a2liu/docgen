# DocGen
DocGen is a document generation helper built using Jekyll, as an alternative to
LaTeX for the uninitiated. It is NOT for blogging.

Uses MathJax for custom styles.

### Examples
See the `examples` folder for examples of how to use this theme.

### Includes API
- `{% include page-break-docgen %}` - Inserts a page break when printing, useful
  when printing to PDF
- `{% include break %}` - Shortcut for `{% include page-break-docgen %}`

### CSS API
Some of the available styles are easier to use without an `include`.

- `pre.utf-box-drawing`, `code.utf-box-drawing` - Sets the font to "Source Code Pro",
  which is compatible with the utf box drawing characters.
- `div.page-break` - A page break.
- `div.horizontal-line` - A container with a 1px black border top.
- `div.display` - A `div` that follows flexbox wrapping rules.
- `ol.heirarchical` - A list that supports the numbered-lettered-numeraled structure.

### Layouts

#### Documents
- `default-docgen` - Base layout for docgen.
- `latex-docgen` - Emulates a LaTeX document.
- `mla-docgen` - Emulates an MLA-style document, i.e. 12pt Times New Roman with header.

#### Utility Pages
- `index-docgen` - Utility page that lists all documents.

### Page & Site Properties
- `lang` - Set the language in `_config.yml` or in the front matter

  All of which are copied verbatim. You can also set `title` in the front matter,
  which is copied verbatim into own paragraph where the MLA standard says it should go.
